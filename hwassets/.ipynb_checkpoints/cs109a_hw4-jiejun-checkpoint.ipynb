It is known that roughly 5% of the labels in the training set are erroneous (i.e. can be arbitrarily different from the true counts), while all the labels in the test set were confirmed to be accurate. Unfortunately, the identities of the erroneous records in the training set are not available. Can this information about presence of 5% errors in the training set labels (without details about the specific identities of the erroneous rows) be used to improve the performance of the model in Part (g)? Note that we are interested in improving the $R^2$ performance of the model on the test set (not the training $R^2$ score). \n",

    "As a final task, we require you to come up with a strategy to fit a regression model, taking into account the errors in the training set labels. Explain the intuition behind your approach (we do not expect a detailed mathematical justification). Use your approach to fit a regression model on the training set, and compare its test $R^2$ with the model in Part (g).\n",
